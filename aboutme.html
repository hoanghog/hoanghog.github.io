    About Me

<h2>
    Intro
</h2>

<p>
    Hello my namme is Martin Hoang, i was born at 1995.06.12 so at the moment i'm 21 years old. I was born in capital city of Slovakia which is Bratislava. I used to live here with my family till my 13th year, but now i'm only studying here and i live in Nove Mesto nad Vahom. It's only one hour far from here so traveling is not big deal for me. From my when i was little kid i liked to play video games, browsing internet, play with friends etc. 
</p>

<h2>
    Computer science and programming
</h2>

<p>
    When i was about to finnish my high-school, i didn't really know what to do next. You know with high school you can only do some basic and exhausting jobs. So i was thinking. I like new technologies, i like computer science, what about to go on informatics? So my jorney has began at Slovak Technical University, Faculty of Informatics and Informational technologies.
</p>

<p>
    Studying here is like... I can't say that i don't like it, but either i can't say that i like it. I had oportunity to get to know many good people who becames my friends, and learn many things i didn't really know they exist. So this is the possitive side of live as a computer nerd. On the other hand i had oportunity to feel like big disgrace, like shit and much more, when i had to makes things which i though that, they are impossible to made in time. You know deadlines are really hard to keep.
</p>

<p>
    After all i have a dream, i have a dream that one day i will graduate at this school. Then i will look back and say to myself, it was worth of time.

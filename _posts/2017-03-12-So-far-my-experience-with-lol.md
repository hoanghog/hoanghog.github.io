Today after sunday mass i had plenty of free time, what to do with it? Firstly i was thinking about my webpage, but then i got better idea. There was League of Legends. So after i start client, bug appeard with question if i want to send it to Riot Games, answer is always no, because this is happening pretty much always. :smiley:

After that, i was waiting in que something about 3 minutes to get total retard team-mates. You know in leage of legends you are supposed to be toxic as possible. It's doesn't mather that you got 7 kills in a row, zero deaths, some assist. Always there will be a guy, who will feed enemies like hell. 

## Difference between others team based online games

League of legends is team based game, and it's not like Counter-Strike: GO for example, because in CS:GO if your teammates sucks, still you can clutch the round for them. But when your team suck in Lol, they not only bad, but also feeding the opposite team, so you can go actually %!#!@ yourself and cry in the corner. 


## What to do? 

My advice is to play League with friends, at least with one, 2 normal guys (to be honest, you are always great, never suck or feed), can make nice game after you will say GG, it was really good game.
